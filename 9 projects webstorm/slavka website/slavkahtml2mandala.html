            	Mandala of the Tree consists of pictures which represent the ideal human being.This Mandala contains ten small Mandalas, and each Mandala has four stones. The four groups of stones represent one area in life. Each group of stones has a stone leader, with the central small Mandala being the most essential one. This heart Mandala contains the four stones that represent spiritual existence. Each level of the stones has the elements that belong to it. We begin from the level of earth, then we step into the element of fire where we start our creation of life. From fire we step to the water element and this element represents purification. The most important four stones representing the spiritual life belong to the heart Mandala the water element. Then we have the wind element and from the wind we step on to the space element. The wind elements represent our mind and the unstable movement of thoughts. For the space element there is only one stone, the most powerful symbol Eternity, which represents time. Time is relative, and untouchable.

        	<p>
	        	Mandala of the Cross is a picture and symbolic formula that shows that the meaning of life is a path to the realization of unconditional love. In this picture we have 25 stones with each stone having a symbolic meaning. Seven fields of this graphic picture have six groups of four stones, and the last and most important stone is on a peak. At the base is a stone, and the meaning of this symbol is a Human being. Then we have the next symbol which is the Shadow. The meaning of the Shadow is the past that is all actions which we have completed. The most important symbol is at the centre of the Mandala, the Crystal and represents belief. This stone is a leader of three other stones and the fusion of these 4 stones represent the vital point of spiritual life. The Crystal from the left-hand side has a Heart and from the right-hand side a Stick. Surrounded by these two symbols the Crystal gives us a message of strong indestructible love. The next symbol on top of the crystal is a Diamond. It belongs to the mind field. The Diamond gives us a message of truth united with the symbol on top that of Eternity. They lead us to the meaning of unlimited or absolute truth.

            Mandala of the Circle is an image that brings to us in a specific way the fact that each of us has a Buddha nature. At the same time this graphic illustration shows the symbolic image which describes the law of karma. The five stones in the centre represent the Buddha nature. The four red stones represent the essential principle of the law of cause and effect. The stone leader has a meaning of a Shadow and it represents our past and also intention. The next stone represents the circumstances and is signified by a Shoe. Then we have a stone that symbolizes the Feet, which means action. And the last stone that is connected with this group of stones is footsteps or a Track. The green stones belong to the element of air and they represent the movement of thoughts, and the yellow stones represent the earth and the material level of existence.
